What is it for?\nThe larger goal of the Discourse forum is to act as a Knowledge base for the course. You can make this more productive by\nElaborating your question sufficiently and supporting it with steps that you have already tried at your end before posting this question\nSharing additional content or explanations related to the topic being discussed\n-  Are there any rules for posting in this category?\nBefore you create a new post, review the existing threads to see if there are already highly similar or identical postings. Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles\nTag the post appropriately so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1\nProvide a meaningful title to your post that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like “AQ1.1 Q3” which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - “Need help in calculating the\nN\nth\nprime number”\nType in your question and explanations rather than pasting images or screenshots.\n- What is NOT Permitted in this category?\nBeing argumentative or sarcastic\nUse of abusive/strong language\nPosting support/logistics related query\nUnnecessarily tagging Faculty/Instructors in posts\nPosting Solutions or discussing solutions to graded assignments\n- Who will be moderating the content in this forum?\nThe foum will be moderated by Course Instructors. They will have the authority to decide whether a post violates forum rules/guidelines. You can flag/report any such violations that you observe by clicking on icon on the post. Please do mention the reason why you are flagging the topic.\n  - What are the disciplinary actions if some one violates the rules and guidelines of the forum? \nThe flagged posts that violates forum rules/guidelines will be hidden. Repeated violation of the rules can result in the offender being removal from the forum.\n\nCan some course instructor talk more about the Discover the problem statement ?\n\nFrom the graded assignment we can’t understand what is right way to think unless we make trial and error. can we have some practice assignment to understand our thinking process is properly aligned or not. With just GA it would be difficult to assess.\n\nApart from what\n@CKPIITM\nobserved about this course, here’s my first impression of this course…Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway…\nThe week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective. It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard. The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point. What’s the context and the motivation? Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text. Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker. Neither does give me much understanding anyway. It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up. The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\nSummary. I feel the course is offered too early. Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about. At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program. I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.\nSorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one. I just had to. I’m willing to hear different opinions.\nI’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.\n\nI am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.\nHopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.\n\nI feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don’t know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.\nBut I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only “comprehension” type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.\n\nAs of now, I’m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week. Will continue after all other ML courses are done…\n\nSome sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts.\nIn the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share.\n\nAdding to the discussion here, I’d also have to say it’s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it’s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.\n\nParticipants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it.\nThe other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.\n\nI also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.\n\nAs my peers said i also feels the same way but i don’t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.\n\nwell, my choice of dropping might be wrong…but, guided by the following factors.\nThe recording was perhaps done much earlier as\n@CKPIITM\npointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would’ve been already recorded. So, lesser chances to re-record them.\nThere are no live sessions planned yet for this course… the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it’s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.\nFinally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.\n\nImagine if your reason doesn’t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don’t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material.\n@Anand\n\nCKPIITM:\nI know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning.\nwasn’t it you who wrote this earlier\n\nBut this will not lead me to dropping either. I always find ways to learn. I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge.\n\nI certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread.\nIn my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question.\n\nI also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced.\n\nI too find content of week 1 engaging and practical. I agree with\n@anand095\nand\n@akruti\n.\n\nInteresting! Just this morning, during my morning walk I was thinking how each of us is different in our outlook, our potential, how we realize it, how we’re challenged…and the recent posts show that we indeed are different! It’s important that none of us stay put on what works for us and what we think is right, but be willing to see the other point of view too…\nI think I’m starting to understand the other points of view…well I’m trying to"

It’s designed to be a convenient web-based alternative for those of you who’ve been encountering issues running promptfoo directly in your terminal.\nYou can find it here: https://pftester3-wxh2d9yfq8b2bgbeiba8x9.streamlit.app/\nThis is not a tool by IITM and not a tool to think that your API is fully working correctly and conditioned to be 100% correct in official evaluations. This is just promptfoo but online instead of your terminal\nHelpful for:\nNot able to run or configure promptfoo locally\nGetting errors and not able to understand how to fix them\nWant to test your deployed API to make sure its working\nWho this is not for:\nTesting local APIS (localhost:8000/query etc)\nWho have no idea as to how promptfoo works and are just viewing the end results (Please check the outputs of each reponse as well in depth)\nHow does it work?\nSubmit your evaluation: Just like with promptfoo locally, you’ll configure your test in the interface.\nGet a Job ID: Once submitted, you’ll receive a unique job ID.\nRetrieve results: After 2-4 minutes (this is an estimated time and might increase with higher load), you can use this job ID to view the detailed logs of your evaluation.\nImportant Notes:\nAPI Key Required: You’ll still need to obtain your API key from aiproxy to use this evaluator.\nTime to Logs: While the current average time to get your evaluation logs is 2-4 minutes, please be aware that if the load on the service increases, this time might also increase. I’ll do my best to keep you updated if I see average times increasing significantly.\nI built this utility to streamline the testing process, especially for those who’ve had trouble getting promptfoo up and running. I hope you find it useful!\n\nsame question\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n\nHello guys, can anyone confirm if render is working for anyone or the server is actually down?\n\nSimilar thing happening to me too. When using curl it gives proper output with relevant links but the yaml file is no returning the links at all.\n\nIt is online currently and working, your specific application might be having issues check that .\nAlso for everyone that will be using Render make sure that on 15,\nTomorrow the service will be under maintenance and you might not be able to do any work within that time period, look out for the notice : https://status.render.com/\n\nBut this is what I am getting every time I try to check the dashboard.\n\nAnybody help me with this?\n\nI think you forgot to add the https://.\n\nProbably a late thought, I have tried to give top3 matching results using RAG as a response along with the url. To avoid failing any of the 10 test cases about to be evaluated, I can increase limit to top 10, but is there any limit set. Was this discussed earlier ? Can someone clarify."

It may be recoverable, but for future make sure you have regular backups of your work in the cloud like on OneDrive or Google Drive. Then recovery from fatal erasures is trivial.\nAs far as how to recover the files totally depends on what happened and if you have any recovery systems in place.

Or if your work is all within OneDrive for example.\nKind regards\n\nkritika0806:\ni even cant recall that what exactly code i wrote in git bash due to which this happened\nYou should take a look at your bash history.

When I try submitting the URL from my phone I get a correct answer whereas from my laptop I get this error. Is it an issue of caching in the browser?\n\nHi\n@23f2004759\nCan you look under network tab what the response is?\nIt might be browser that’s causing issue.\n\nYes I tried using a different browser and it worked just fine.

Could you please include a ngrok-skip-browser-warning header in the evaluation request, or provide a way to bypass this issue?\n\nSo now can we do this ques? Were there some kind of issue on the website?\n@Jivraj\n\nHi,\nFor the assignment 10. I was able to create the FastAPI application and run queries based on random classes from the dataset and with multiple classes in a single api call, All the responses are as expected, But when I check in the portal no matter what I do the check fails. I tested the queries being sent when I click the check button, I copied the url, test it in my local rest client and got the results which I think are correct. Below is the url and its output (truncated the response).\nsample input\n127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=12W&class=10O&class=5B&class=5J\noutput\n{\n  \"students\": [\n    {\n      \"studentId\": \"69\",\n      \"class\": \"12W\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"studentId\": \"320\",\n      \"class\": \"12W\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"studentId\": \"538\",\n      \"class\": \"10O\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"studentId\": \"598\",\n      \"class\": \"5J\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"studentId\": \"637\",\n      \"class\": \"10O\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"studentId\": \"657\",\n      \"class\": \"5B\"\n    },\n....\n  ]\n}\nI get the error\nError: At [0].studentId: Values don't match\nAssuming that the check is done in Ascending order then first element is the smallest and the first element in the csv file.\nPlease help me in identifying the issue or guide me in the right direction.\n\nHi,\nI still get an error\nTypeError: Failed to fetch\nthe same url is working in cli, and in browser too with the warning.\n\nin Q11, i am facing this issue while creating an organization, Your current account, [23f3003724@ds.study.iitm.ac.in], doesn’t have the permissions to perform this task. Log into the Cloud Console using either your Workspace or Cloud Identity super administrator account. You can also copy a link to this Users and Groups task and request that your super administrator complete this step.\nkindly help me with this..\n\nin Q6, that one including vercel deployement, i performed the deployement, but the deployement shows deployement not found to me, what could be the possible reason if any of u dealt with a similar issue?\n\n@Jivraj\nsir i am facing issues in the vercel question that is the 6th one my deployment is working fine infact i am getting the results as per the question but when i submit the link on the portal it says FAILED TO FETCH.\nbut when i paste the same link in my browser with and without parameters i get the desired result\n\nYou need to get the oauth credentials from your personal account to setup the OAuth. Then you can use the IITM Account when choosing the account in the actual application run.\n\nokay, well i am done with the issues i was facing, thank you, could u just tell me if we have some sort of limit for requesting in Q12??\n\nin GA-2 yesterday night i solved 6 question and saved all of them last submission shows 6/10 . but today when i started solving remaining question and after saving again it showing 2.75/10 . some question like 9,11 which was based on local showing incorrect now. in yesterday session sir told whatever you do just save it it will persist as solving all 10 Questions in one go is not possible .\nsir, pls clearify , do i have to to solve all question in one go, as after doing shut down it all vanishes despite saving .\n\nFor the GA2, its better to submit all at once as a lot of the answer changes based on the time & duration from last run, as well as you need to make sure that the local servers are running. Token & codesapces timeout after a certain period and you need to redo those.\nEasiest way is to do till q8 one by one and anytime you like they are persistent, and for all the rest try to do them at a sitting and don’t close any of the servers (local apis, codespace, ngrok) till all submit\n\nSome submissions require live server, so you have to run that particular code everytime you are solving those questions."

    "title": "A humble request to the TDS Course Team",
    "content": "@carlton\nand\n@Jivraj\nRespected Sir\nIt was my first time doing web scraping and other tasks required for this project. After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good but, they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don’t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner.\nThank you.\n\n23f1000917:\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow.
